                    In the beginning of 2020, before COVID, I had the privilege of traveling to the Gal치pagos Islands with
                    a group of fellow students for research. The research was a broad investigation into evolution and ecology,
                    exploring how they shape each other and are ever-present in the flora and fauna of the Gal치pagos.
                    It was a once in a lifetime opportunity that also changed my life.

                        The comeback of the tortoises is one of the greatest success stories in conservation history.
